Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

smaple one   GC-content: 0.43029262963
sample two   GC-content: 0.451051333333
sample three GC-content: 0.646864112524
sample four  GC-content: 0.347852341166
sample five  GC-content: 0.263157894737
sample six   GC-content: 0.491518518519

Problem 3:

Program won't run because then there won't be any variables set. Same thing happens for gc_count = 0 because there will be no starting point.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.568993851852

Collaboration:

rawjor18, am0k. Looked at some parts that I was stuck to understand how I should be modifying the program.

Reflection:

I thought this looked very challenging and I was afraid I wouldn't know how to do it. It looks really complicated and I didn't fully understand what we had to do with DNA analysis. After working through it, I realized that it was just something that looks complicated but we were asked to do something that wasn't so much so. A beginner like me would probably be nervous doing these things. But once I understood what we really had to do, I managed to understand the instructions and followed it. I had to look up some people's work to understand how and why to program it that way. It was very helpful and I have a much better understanding of it now.
